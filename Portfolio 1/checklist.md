Interesting Points Section

1. Notice that the elements of Square and how props are passed into that Component
2. Notice that to change the values of state variables, besides the constructor, one has to use the setState() method. This is an asynchronous call and therefore reading the value of the state variables right after the call will not have the updated state. So, it can be seen that the second parameter to the function is another function that will get called after the setState method completes.
3. Notice the CSS styles are associative arrays and not strings
4. Notice the JSX notation that allows Components to be represented as HTML/XML elements and have variables passed as parameters
